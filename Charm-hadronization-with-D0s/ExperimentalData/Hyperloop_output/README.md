# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset, including signal extraction, background subtraction, data visualization, and efficiency estimation. The main tasks are as follows:

1. **Signal Extraction**: Implement a method to extract the signal from the dataset.
2. **Background Subtraction**: Develop a technique to subtract the background from the dataset.
3. **Plotting and Comparison**: Create visualizations to compare the results of the signal extraction and background subtraction methods.
4. **General Investigations**: Perform additional analyses and investigations on the dataset.
5. **Efficiency Estimation**: Estimate the efficiencies of the various methods used in the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` directory. The file name is `dataset.csv`.
