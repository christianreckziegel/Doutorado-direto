# HF jet tagging simulations

The workflow is separated in simulation with Pythia 8 and reconstruction and analysis with FastJet and ROOT.

## Directory Structure

- **Pythia_stage**: Hard QCD with different size data sets simulated (1k, 10k, 100k, 1m).
- **FastJet_stage**: identification of heavy flavour decay candidates, checking of invariant mass, jet tagging and analysis.

## Future work

Implement Machine Learning methods for tagging heavy flavour jets.
